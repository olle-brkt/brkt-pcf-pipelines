# brkt-pcf-pipelines

This repo is a collection of operations, tasks and other resources to create or
upgrade PCF deployments secured by Bracket.

## `install-brkt-pcf` pipeline

### Usage

#### Patching the stock pipeline

The brkt-pcf-pipelines are generated by performing a set of [`yaml-patch`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/yaml-patch) operations
on the stock `pipeline.yml` from the [pcf-pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines) project.

This can be done in a number of ways. For convenience, a `Makefile` and a `Dockerfile` are included which allows you to:
```
export PCF_PIPELINE_PATH=path/to/pcf-pipeline/install-pcf/aws/pipeline.yml
make patch-pipeline
```
which will output the generated pipeline.

If you already have [`yaml-patch`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/yaml-patch) and [`fly`](https://concourse.ci/fly-cli.html) installed, it is as simple as:
```
fly format-pipeline -c <(cat path/to/pcf-pipeline/install-pcf/aws/pipeline.yml | yaml-patch -o path/to/brkt-pcf-pipelines/operations/brktize.yml)
```


With the pipeline patched, the rest of the steps listed below are identical with the [pcf-pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines) project, **with the exception of step 3 and 4:**
* In step 3, we also need to modify the [`brkt-params.yml`](https://github.com/olle-brkt/brkt-pcf-pipelines/blob/master/install-brkt-pcf/brkt-params.yml).
* In step 4, we use the patched pipeline and we also use load params from [`brkt-params.yml`](https://github.com/olle-brkt/brkt-pcf-pipelines/install-brkt-pcf/brkt-params.yml) when setting the pipeline.


The rest of the steps are just copied over from [pcf-pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines) for convenience.

#### Deploy PCF (mostly) as usual

This pipeline uses Terraform to create the infrastructure required to run a
3 AZ PCF deployment on AWS per the Customer [reference
architecture](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/refarch/aws/aws_ref_arch.html).

This pipeline downloads artifacts from DockerHub (czero/rootfs and custom
docker-image resources) and the configured S3 bucket
(terraform.tfstate file), and as such the Concourse instance must have access
to those. Note that Terraform outputs a .tfstate file that contains plaintext
secrets.

1. Create a versioned bucket for holding terraform state.

2. Ensure [the prerequisites are met](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-12/customizing/aws.html#prerequisities), in particular:

* A key pair to use with your PCF deployment. For more information, see the AWS documentation about [creating a key pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-keypair.html).
* Create a public DNS zone, get its zone ID and place it in params.yml under `ROUTE_53_ZONE_ID`
* [Generate a certificate](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/ssl-server-cert.html#create-cert) for the domain used in the public DNS zone.

3. Change all of the CHANGEME values in [`params.yml`](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines/blob/master/install-pcf/aws/params.yml) and [`brkt-params.yml`](https://github.com/olle-brkt/brkt-pcf-pipelines/blob/master/install-brkt-pcf/brkt-params.yml) with real values.

4. [Set the pipeline](http://concourse.ci/single-page.html#fly-set-pipeline), using the modified [`pipeline.yml` from the patch steps](https://github.com/olle-brkt/brkt-pcf-pipelines#patch-the-stock-pipeline), your updated `params.yml` and your updated `brkt-params.yml`:
  ```
  fly -t target set-pipeline -p deploy-brkt-pcf -c pipeline.yml -l params.yml -l brkt-params.yml
  ```

5. Unpause the pipeline

6. Run `bootstrap-terraform-state` job manually. This will prepare the s3 resource that holds the terraform state. This only needs to be run once.

7. `create-infrastructure` will automatically upload the latest matching version of Operations Manager

8. Once DNS is set up you can run `configure-director`. From there the pipeline should automatically run through to the end.

### Tearing down the environment

There is a job, `wipe-env`, which you can run to destroy the infrastructure
that was created by `create-infrastructure`.

If you want to bring the environment up again, run `create-infrastructure`.

Do NOT use username `admin` for any of database credentials that you configure for this pipeline.
